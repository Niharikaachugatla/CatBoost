# 🫀 CatBoost Classifier for Heart Disease Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline using **CatBoost** to predict heart disease from structured clinical data. This project demonstrates end-to-end modeling including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and interpretability — all aligned with best practices and academic standards.

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the most common causes of mortality globally. In this project, we leverage **CatBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting library, to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical and demographic attributes.

CatBoost is particularly well-suited for this task due to its **native handling of categorical features**, **robust performance**, and **interpretable output**.
